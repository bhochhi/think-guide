SRP: Single Responsibility Principles
---
"Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only."  
 \- Robert C. Martin

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live"  
\- Rick Osborne \-Martin Golding

"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."   
\- Martin Fowler 

“Everyday life is like programming, I guess. If you love something, you can put beauty into it.”

~ Donald Knuth

“The ratio of time spent reading (code) versus writing is well over 10 to 1 ... (therefore) making it easy to read makes it easier to write.”

LeBlanc's Law
---
“Later equals never.”

"Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to be written."

"In order to make sure our functions are doing 'one thing', we need to make sure that the statements within the function are all at the same level of abstraction."


Functions
---
"The first rule of functions is that they should be small."
"Functions should do something, or answer something, but not both."
"Methods should have verb or phrase names."
"One way to know that a function is doing more than 'one thing' is if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation."

Comments
---
"Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression."


SOLID
---
The Single Responsibility Principle
 "One class should do one thing and do it well"
The Open Closed Principle
 "Open for extension, closed for modification"
The Liskov Substitution Principle
 "Sub type must be substitutable for super type"
The Interface Segregation Principle
 "Avoid monolithic interface, reduce pain on client side"
The Dependency Inversion principle
 "Don't ask, let framework give to you"

Delegation principle
---
Don't do all things by yourself, delegate it! 

Simple things should be simple and complex things should be possible.
—Alan Kay

Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming.
—C.A.R. Hoare

First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. 

Talk is cheap, show me the code!  
  \-Linus Torvalds
If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.
\-Cicero
Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
\-Edsger W. Dijkstra
The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.
\-Robert C. Martin
Code never lies, comments sometimes do.
\-Ron Jeffries


Law of Demeter
---
A component or object should not know about internal details of other components or objects.


“We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to customers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use. We are finding that people like products that just work. It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to produce that designs that assemble long lists of features.” 
\― Douglas Crockford, JavaScript: The Good Parts

"Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.”
\– Michael Sinz

"I'm not a great programmer, I'm a good programmer with great habits"
\- Kent Beck
