Motivation is the push. Inspiration is the pull.” (I love this response!) —Natalie DeBruin

If you are disciplined, you get things done. YOu don't wait right time to do it. 


If you want to get anything done, there are two basic ways to get yourself to do it.  
___

The first, more popular is to try to motivate yourself.

The second, somewhat unpopular choice is to cultivate discipline, just do it.if you continue with discipline, soon it becames your habit. and 
once its habit you don't even need to thnk about it. You will just do it!!

Discipline, don't not looks for excuses, does not seek for right time to start, Discipline doesn't tie with your feelings or mood.  


What’s the difference?


Motivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional state is necessary to complete a task.

That’s completely the wrong way around.

Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them.

If action is conditional on feelings, waiting for the right mood becomes a particularly insidious form of procrastination. I know that too well, and wish somebody pointed it out for me twenty, fifteen or ten years ago before I learned the difference the hard way.
