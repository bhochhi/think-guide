Folks, new year is right up in the corner and so are our resolutions and goals. I bet you already have bucket full of todo list that you want to do starting new year. I already have mine!! Get in shape, wake up early:join 5am club, eat healthy, learn a new language:one language per year, improve communication and leadership, earn more money and list goes on on!!

Not surprisingly, these were almost the same commitments I had this year, and I can confidently say its the same I had previous year and year before that!! I don't have to remember my wishlist anymore because they have stayed the same, none were checked as a result of completion.

I remember the story about the lizard that my mom used to tell me. Lizard are only the animal who doesn't have a house because they never built one. Ant builts the house and so do the birds and spiders. Its not that lizard has no plan building the house. but every morning, when sun raises, they gets outside the wall and get tanned on warm sunlight and totally forget about building the house. Then it gets darker, cooler again the, for all night they start planning to build the house. They commit themselves, tomorrow as soon as there is some light I will get and build the house. Planning and grooming happens all night then, when time comes same story again. The fact that mother telling me such story tells me something about me. I am a lizard!! 

But not any more, I have found this formula and it works and today I want to share with you and so that you can take an advantage of it. 

What I found was, the reason why my resolution never get accomplished, 
- it wasn't because my resolutions or goals were unclear or too vague. They has been precise and they has been very important for me and my family. It was "Motivation", I was always waiting for some sort of motivation to start on my bucketlist. I had good motives and motivation came to me too! but it didn't last long enough so that I could complete my goals. 

- If you want to get anything done, there are two basic ways to get yourself to do it.  
 1. The first, more popular but prone to fail is to try to motivate yourself.
 2. The second, somewhat unpopular way is to cultivate discipline.
 
Why motivation doesn't work? Because:
- Motivation is not continuance.  
- Motivation is not consistence.
- Motivation doesn't guaranty completion
- Motivation is volatile
- Motivation depends on your mental state, looks for right time to start.
- So, Motivation is pychological phenonmenon, associated with feelings.  
- Motivation is soul crushing  

On the other hand, Discipline works because:
- Discipline, doesn't not look for excuses, 
- Discipline simply does not seek for right time to start, 
- Discipline doesn't tie with your feelings or mood,
- Discipline create the path to the destiny,
- Disciple creates the confidence, 
- Disciple demands for the action, 
- Discipline creates the trust, 
- Discipline make you independent, 
- Discipline makes your goal realistic,
- Discipline is real!!, 
- Discipline give result,
- Discipline just does it.

Yes, just do it. if you continue with this idea, soon it becames your habit. and once its habit you don't even need to thnk about it. You will just do it!! 

### The thing is we keep too much focus on the goals,but what is more important is the journey, the process, the actions plan that generates  the momemtum that finally takes you to your destiny. And Now I am convince Discipline is only the tool/weapon we have for your journey, not motivation. So, if you are disciplined, you get things done. You don't wait right time to do it. 
Therefore Stop chasing for Motivation. why you need motivation? When you are deciplined? If action is conditional on feelings, waiting for the right mood becomes a particularly insidious form of procrastination. I know that too well, and wish somebody pointed it out for me twenty, fifteen or ten years ago before I learned the difference the hard way.



So my general purpose is try to cut the link between feelings and actions. 





Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them.



Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing.

How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a positive feedback loop.

Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. 


At its core, chasing motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing things we feel like doing. The problem is then framed thus: “How do I get myself to feel like doing what I have rationally decided to do?”. Bad.

The proper question is “How do I make my feelings inconsequential and do the things I consciously want to do without being a little bitch about it?”.

### The point is to cut the link between feelings and actions, and do it anyway. You get to feel good and buzzed and energetic and eager afterwards.
