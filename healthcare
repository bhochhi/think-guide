I may be excused for my ignorance on this topic, but I decided to share my experience that I been through last few weeks, this is not the complain nor this is any frustration. Just sharing my experience and analysing how this wouldn't happen again. 

Have you ever  second-guessed your doctors' decisions? Have you ever asked and reasked why he is asking for cetain 
lab works and evaluation? Because I didn't, may be this is just our cuture that we don't question and ask enough. 
Just like we don't question much on our parent judgments. Asking questions on something you are told to do mean dishonor. Yes this has to be just cutural defect our side. 
However this culture has been built upon trust and believe. And there is a lot of trust we put on doctors too. 
Yes we trust their judgement, we trust our live on their decision. 

Unfortunately, Not all healthcare provider driven by same values, ethics and principles. 
Some might be just profits oriented and while other are self centrics. But don't get mistaken, there are plennty for good caring service providers too. That's why I have never had such negative encounters in my 30 years of life.

This happened with us when I had to take my son to his pediatrician when he developed some rashes and swelling early morning. I didn't care much coz' he was playing and acting normally. But his mother wanted to take his to dr. So we did. Dr. checked his urine and asked for blood and heart test. He referred us to hospital. There we were admitted to ER. Then I started wondering what's going on, we have never been to ER before. All we know was ER is for emergency purpose.But why we were there? Son was acting pefectly normal and playing and yelling and pressing buzzer to call our nurse. 4 hours of enclosure inside ER room gave us ample amount of time to google and find similar symptoms that my son was having. We started having some confidence that there is noting wrong, this could be just some side effects from his viral illness. Then had enough courage to argue with ER doc. to send us home. Then finally he give some benadryl and wanted to do blood works and heart check, EKG. But we don't wanted to do any more. Since dr. insisted for at EKG at least. we did it and headed home. 

That was one of the terrible day in our life. The worst part is still to be shared. The hospital administration got our insurance and handed us the bill of $4860 after insurance. My goodness, what crime did we commited. What mistake did we do? all we expected was some care. What kind of service was that. More We analyze about this more we start doubting the judgement of the doc. Where is this care, we call primary care? What made doc to think its good idea to send us to ER? Is this just one case or is there a trend amony health providers to over test and over evalute and as a result patients ended up with 1000s of dollars of medical debts? Nearly a million people files for bankruptcy every year and half of them are related to their inability to pay medical bills. 

In conclusion, I value and appreciate the services and responsibilities that healthcare provider provides for healthy society. I have always put 2 professions above any others for the healthy society and better future: Education and Healthcare. So, Unless we have service oriented healthcare providers rather than profit oriented, Unless we encourage using common sense and ethics among healthcare providers rather than dogmatic and self centric culture, I don't believe any kind of healthcare reform will address the issues like we had. And yes, we as a consumer/patient also need to be responsible, ask questions and know something about the services you are getting. It turned out some knowledge is better no knowledge. So Take advantages of modern technology.
